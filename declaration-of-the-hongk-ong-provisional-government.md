In the evolution of mankind, rebuilding a better future upon the past is destiny. If the old government does not serve the people, the people will build a government that belongs to them. The Hong Kong government today no longer serves the people of Hong Kong, hence today we declare the formation of the Hong Kong Provisional Government.

“All people are equal. Human rights such as the right to live, the right to freedom, the right to dignity, and the right to a better life are God-given rights inalienable to all mankind.” This is a principle and a truth that we all stand by. The people created law and order and governments to protect their own rights. All power of the government comes from the people. If a government destroys the principle above, the people have absolute power to take down the government and rebuild.

The Hong Kong SAR government today is controlled by the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party. Instead of serving the people, the Hong Kong government instead ignores the demands of the people, continually stripped the people of its power and rights, and passed laws that are against the welfare of the people. The Hong Kong SAR government today, disregarding the wishes of the majority of Hong Kong people, circumvented the Hong Kong Legislative Council to pass the “Anti-Mask Law” in an attempt to suppress the people’s right to demonstrations further. We believe that the Hong Kong SAR government has lost the recognition of the people, thus today we announce that the Hong Kong SAR government has lost its legality, and the Chief Executive and the Secretaries of each government bureau have lost the power inferred upon them by their position, effectively immediately.

The Hong Kong Provisional Government declares:

1. All existing Hong Kong SAR Government Bureaus are now under the Hong Kong Provisional Government.

2. The Chief Executive, Chief Secretaries, and Secretaries of each Bureau within the Hong Kong SAR Government shall immediately vacate their positions. The positions will remain empty until appointed by the Hong Kong Provisional Government.

3. All bureaus shall immediately halt all policies announced by the Hong Kong SAR Government since 2018. All personnel to stay at their existing positions to maintain the every day operations of the bureaus until further notice.

4. The Hong Kong Provisional Government will have a term limit of 5 year or until true universal suffrage is set up (whichever comes first). The Hong Kong Provisional Government must prepare for the election within 1 year of formation, and must complete the election within 3 years.

5. The head of the Hong Kong Provisional Government and the provisional officials of each Bureau, after the end of their terms, are permanently banned from working as an official within the Hong Kong government or any related institutions.

6. The Hong Kong Law will be kept intact until the Hong Kong Provisional Government declares a new code of law.

7. The Hong Kong Legislative Council will be disbanded. A Provisional Legislative Council shall be formed by election within 3 months, with the Legislative Council to be formed again within a year. The Provisional Legislative Council shall have 70 seats, with 12 seats each to Hong Kong Island and Kowloon West, 10 seats to Kowloon East, and 18 seats each to New Territories East and New Territories West.
